# Discrete-Choice-Based-Conjoint-Model
A Computer Choice Study
In 1998 Microsoft introduced a new operating system. Computer manufacturers were interested in making predictions about the personal computer marketplace.  To help manufacturers understand the market for personal computers, we (a bunch of Economics practitioners) conducted a computer choice study. It was a nation wide study, we identified people who expressed an interest in buying a new personal computer within the next year.
The survey consisted of 16 pages, we call it as Choice Sets, with each Choice Set (i.e. each page) comprising 4 Product Profiles. 

For each Choice Set, the survey respondents were asked to select the computer they most prefered (i.e of 4 product profiles in 1 Choice Set, the respondent was asked to choose 1 product profile).

Each product profile is defined in terms of attributes and corresponding levels. They are as follows. Also each product profile has the consumer’s binary choice i.e. 

Choice = 1 if chosen
Choice = 0 if not chosen
